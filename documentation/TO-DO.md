-    create a comprehensive pipline for the entire process from all .md files in the 
     3 folders of the project, based on the research paper  (DONE)

-   find computational needs/dependecies for each step of the process, find a suitable machine that 
    can run the whole thing easily (DONE)

-   once the pipline has been figured out, and computational hardware is aquired, test the pipline on
    the demo set

-   while going through and creating the documentation files, write the interesting notes that could
    be used as changes in the architecture (in progress)

-   research the notes you wrote and look for precendent/promising ideas (in progress)

-   document the final changes you decide to do to the pipline (in progress)

-   implement the changes into the pipline (in progress)

-   remove the parts of the pipline that you do not want to run 

-   test the changes on the demo set to make sure it works, fix problems if they arise

-   run the full pipline on the large dataset

-   find out how you can get real test results,
